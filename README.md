Lunar Landings is a small overhaul which has you build a second base on Nauvis' moon: Luna.

After launching a rocket (brought forwards to chemical science), you gain control of a robot on Luna, which can be switched to at any time. You must mine moon rock to create silicon, required by processing units. After completing utility and production sciences, start producing aluminium from rich moon rock using heat-outputting arc furnaces, and use telescopes placed on Luna mountains to generate data for space science. Utilise astrocrystals and polaritons to research quantum technologies, and then finally launch an interstellar rocket from Luna to win the game.

### How does this compare to [Space Exploration](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-exploration)?
Lunar Landings is a completely standalone mod. Some parts may look similar because it uses some graphics from SE, and since both mods involve building on other planets, there is some gameplay overlap.
Lunar Landings is _significantly_ shorter and easier. No changes are made to vanilla until chemical science, and only 2 new science packs are added (compared to SE's 22).

### How does this compare to [Space Age](https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-373)?
Lunar Landings shares a similar design philosophy to the upcoming Space Age expansion in that it adds a specific named planet, with its own challenges and limitations, and is a natural extension of vanilla gameplay. It is likely that LL and SA will be compatible in the future.

# Information

## Features
- Cheaper rocket silo, with reusable rocket parts
- Moon rock, processed into silicon, stone, and oxygen
- Oxygen diffusers, provide oxygen to nearby machines
- Ice, can be mined and melted to provide water
- Rich moon rock, processed into aluminium, iron, and moon rock
- Arc furnaces, required for aluminium processing and output heat as a byproduct
- Mass driver, used to deliver construction items to Luna based on requests
- Astrocrystals, processed into quantum things...

## Other mods
Alien Biomes is a required mod because it contains some decoratives that Lunar Landings uses for the Luna surface. Feel free to customise its settings as much as you like, such as disabling certain tilesets or turning off tile-based movement penalties.

Lunar Landings is not compatible with any other overhaul mods. It will probably be compatible with [Freight Forwarding](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/FreightForwarding) and Space Age in the future. If you would like to contribute compatibility with another mod, please get in touch.

For quality of life, you are free to choose your own. You can see my general recommendations [here](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/X-QoL).
